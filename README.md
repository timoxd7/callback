# Callback

This is a simple Class to create unified callbacks, no matter if calling to a function or method. It _has_ an overhead, however brings the flexibility to call anything you want. It only uses static memory and can be copied like a normal function pointer, without the need of dynamic memory allocation.

## Inspiration

This was inspired by the callback class found in mbed, then implemented in Steroido (see my Github repos, a small but outdated framework for embedded development) and now gets its own repo.
